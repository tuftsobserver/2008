      <div class="intro">
        <p>It has been 10 full years since 2008&mdash;a time when Flo Rida&rsquo;s <span class="hover" data-filename="low.jpg">Low</span> was the number one song on the charts (and continues to be in my heart), <span class="italic">High School Musical 3</span> was released, and the Jonas Brothers wore <span class="hover" data-filename="rings.jpg">purity rings</span>. And that&rsquo;s most of what was on my 11-year-old radar. But there are ways in which the seemingly menial focuses of <span class="italic">TMZ</span>-based 2008 gossip created the foundation for the more ludicrous headlines of our day. In the budding age of Facebook (founded 2004), Youtube (2005), and Twitter (2006), 2008 was the time that social media began to take its now all-powerful form. So what roots are we to find? Should we go digging?</p>

  <p><span class="big-emph">For one, the public&rsquo;s consumption of Britney Spears&rsquo; emotional rollercoaster ride</span><br />into and through 2008 helped establish the presumed entitlement to all aspects of celebrity lives. Most people place Spears&rsquo; deepest valley at the moment of her 2007 <span class="hover" data-filename="buzz.jpg">buzz cut</span>, but she was also very <a class="click" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/timeline-britneys-meltdown/">publicly hospitalized</a> twice in January of 2008. She was then placed on temporary <a class="click" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship">conservatorship</a>, meaning a guardian or a protector was appointed by a judge to manage her financial affairs and/or daily life; these <a href="#" id="guardians" title=''>guardians</a> are appointed most often due to physical or mental limitations, or old age. Over the course of the year, she regained custody of her two children and eventually released her sixth studio album, <span class="hover" data-filename="circus.jpg">&ldquo;Circus,&rdquo;</span> on November 28. The first two singles released from the album, &ldquo;Womanizer&rdquo; and &ldquo;Circus,&rdquo; hit &ldquo;number one&rdquo; on the Billboard Hot 100. In a <a class="click" href="http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?&id=GALE%7CA433010286&v=2.1&u=mlin_m_tufts&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&authCount=1">Billboard article</a> from late October 2013, Keith Caulfield points out &ldquo;Womanizer&rdquo; was Spears&rsquo; first number one single since her 1999 &ldquo;Baby One More Time&rdquo; sensation. Caulfield also notes that during her December 2, 2008 live performance of &ldquo;Womanizer&rdquo; on Good Morning America, &ldquo;a reinvigorated Spears returned to the airwaves,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;her career has mostly flourished since then.&rdquo; Indeed, her ninth studio album, <span class="hover" data-filename="glory.jpg">&ldquo;Glory,&rdquo;</span> was included in year-end lists of best albums by <span class="italic">Slant Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Digital Spy</span>, Fuse, <span class="italic">Glamour</span>, AOL, and <span class="italic">Rolling Stone</span>. Her August 2016 performance of <a class="click" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGDeAWDNaZo">&ldquo;Make Me&hellip;&rdquo;</a> a few days after the album&rsquo;s release at the MTV Video Music Awards was a success, and her first time returning to that particular stage since her decidedly &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; performance of <a class="click" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udDlSRgyxMc">&ldquo;Gimme More&rdquo;</a> in 2007. (By which I mean she half-heartedly lip-synched, tottered around off-balance and rigid, and at one point grabbed the junk of someone on stage with her. There were also pole dancers.) Spears performed her final show of the <span class="italic">Britney: Piece of Me</span> tour on December 31, 2017, a performance that netted 1.172 million and was <a class="click" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears">&ldquo;broadcast live with performances of Toxic and Work Bitch airing on ABC's Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve to a record audience of 25.6 million.&rdquo;</a> Britney&rsquo;s highly personal, and no doubt painful, mental health journey was bore for the world to see, judge, and poke fun at. But everyone loves a comeback kid. And of course, complete transparency with the public about your private life and process of healing is the price you pay for fame and commercial success.</p>

  <div class = "section sectiontwo">
    <p>Speaking of complete transparency with the public, January 2008 is also the month that Tom Cruise&rsquo;s legendary Scientology <span class="hover" data-filename="scientology.jpg">promotional video</span> was leaked. I remember the Tom Cruise scientology jokes, but this was something that went right over my sixth-grade, five-foot-high head. Nick Denton&rsquo;s January 15 coverage of the video on Gawker&rsquo;s site quips, &ldquo;if Tom Cruise jumping on Oprah's couch was an 8 on the scale of scary, this is a 10.&rdquo; <a class="click" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFBZ_uAbxS0">Cruise&rsquo;s interview portion</a> is incredibly convoluted and onomatopoeia-heavy, with a few pretty sinister cackles. The most summary Cruise quote would be &ldquo;I wish the world was a different place. I&rsquo;d like to go on vacation, and go and romp, and play, and just&hellip; and do that, you know what I mean? I mean. That&rsquo;s what I want it to be, okay? That&rsquo;s how, you know, there&rsquo;s times I&rsquo;d like to do that. But I can&rsquo;t. Because&hellip; I know. I know.&rdquo; The clip of the interview ends with a dramatic voice over that states, &ldquo;A scientologist can be defined by a single question: would you want others to achieve the knowledge you now have? In answering that question, Tom Cruise has introduced LRH technology to over one billion people of Earth. And that&rsquo;s only the first wave he&rsquo;s unleashed. Which is why the story of Tom Cruise, Scientologist, has only just begun.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><a class="click" href="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise_Scientology_promotional_video_leaked_to_the_Internet">Evidently</a>, the entire 40 minute special was for a 2004 meeting of the International Association of Scientologists at which Cruise was given the <span class="hover" data-filename="medal.png">&ldquo;freedom medal.&rdquo;</span> The Church of Scientology didn&rsquo;t respond well to the reproduction of their content, and claimed copyright infringement on several publications of the video, resulting in far more media attention than it likely would&rsquo;ve otherwise received.</p>
</div>
<div class = "section sectionthree">
  <p><a class="click" href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15348423.2017.1311121?scroll=top&needAccess=true&">In the same month</a>, Andrew Morton appeared on the <span class="italic">Today Show</span> to (somewhat defensively) discuss his forthcoming book, <span class="italic hover" data-filename="biography.jpg">Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography,</span> in which he writes of Cruise&rsquo;s relationship with the Church. When Meredith Vieira questioned Morton&rsquo;s decision to call Cruise &ldquo;compelling and dangerous,&rdquo; Morton responded, &ldquo;I think in this age of celebrity, where celebrities get a free pass to assert as opposed to argue, where they get access to presidents, prime ministers, and politicians not because of what they know but because of who they are, that&mdash;then that is&mdash;that&rsquo;s a dangerous slide into an unreflective world.&rdquo; This is a pretty fair description&mdash;the narrator of the video mentions Cruise&rsquo;s meetings with NASA as well as a Japanese Prime Minister (and calls him &ldquo;America&rsquo;s samurai&rdquo;).</p>
  <p>What better way than Morton&rsquo;s quotation to describe the last decade politically? While the <span class="hover" data-filename="obama.jpg">2008 campaign and election of Barack Obama</span> were historic, the effects it had on the US racial climate are of great relevance now, one decade later. The country&rsquo;s first Black president led many to make the bold claim that the US had become a post-racial utopia, which the years since have proven unequivocally false. Most recently, <a class="click" href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/1687/race-relations.aspx">Gallup&rsquo;s June 7 &ndash; July 1, 2016 results</a> show that nationally, 29 percent of adults believed that as a result of Obama, race relations in the country had improved either a lot or a little and 46 percent believed they had gotten a lot or a little worse. This is a big shift from October 2009 results, in which 41 percent of respondents felt there had been a net positive result and only 22 percent felt there was any negative. Additionally, the percentage of adults who worried a &ldquo;great deal&rdquo; or a &ldquo;fair amount&rdquo; about race relations in the US rose from 45 percent in 2008 to 62 percent in 2016. Also of contemporary importance is the <span class="hover" data-filename="birther.jpg">Birther Movement</span> that grew from the 2008 election and Trump&rsquo;s eventual involvement in it. His 2011 letter in USA Today titled &ldquo;Obama, come clean&rdquo; may have been of the same generic, jokey pabulum as Spears and Cruise at the time, but we (<span class="italic">should</span>, at the very least) know better now.</p>
</div>
<p>Discussing moments like <span class="hover" data-filename="britney.jpg">Spears&rsquo; meteoric rise</span> and <span class="hover" data-filename="rant.jpg">Cruise&rsquo;s cultish rants</span> in conjunction with a presidential election and subsequent changes in perceptions of race relations may seem ham-fisted, but in the same decade Trump managed to seamlessly permeate the barrier between pap and politics. 2008 headlines with Trump&rsquo;s name covered his separation with Ivana, his buying (or not buying) Ed McMahon&rsquo;s house, and one from Fox News titled &ldquo;Pop Tarts: Donald Trump Gets Emotional Over Christina Aguilera.&rdquo; 2018 Trump headlines include &ldquo;Trump says he rejects feminism because he is 'for everyone,'&rdquo; &ldquo;Trump taunts Jay-Z about black unemployment,&rdquo; (over Twitter, of course), and &ldquo;Trump says he didn't know UK far-right group were 'horrible racists.'&rdquo; Perhaps the events of 2008 can teach us that the more we idolize celebrities, blur the lines between public, private, and political, and refuse to concern ourselves with the truth, the more the world will seem to fall apart.</p>
