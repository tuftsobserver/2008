      <div class = "intro">
        <p>It has been ten full years since 2008. Low was the number one song on the charts (and continues to be in my heart), High School Musical 3 was released, and the Jonas Brothers wore purity rings. And that&rsquo;s most of what was on my eleven-year-old radar. So what else were we paying attention to as a country (besides Twilight), and where has that gotten us in the past ten years?</p>

  <p>For one, Britney Spears had quite the 2008. Most people place her deepest valley at the moment of her 2007 buzz cut, but she was also very publicly hospitalized twice in January of 2008. Spears was then placed on temporary conservatorship, meaning a guardian or a protector was appointed by a judge to manage her financial affairs and/or daily life; these guardians are appointed most often due to physical or mental limitations, or old age. Over the course of the year, she regained custody of her two children and eventually released her sixth studio album, Circus, on November 28. Both singles released from the album, &ldquo;Womanizer&rdquo; and &ldquo;Circus&rdquo; hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. In a Billboard article from late October 2013, Keith Caulfield describes &ldquo;Womanizer&rdquo; as Spears&rsquo; first number one single since her 1999 &ldquo;Baby One More Time.&rdquo; Caulfield also notes that during her December 2, 2008 live performance of &ldquo;Womanizer&rdquo; on Good Morning America, &ldquo;a reinvigorated Spears returned to the airwaves,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;her career has mostly flourished since then.&rdquo; Indeed, her ninth studio album, Glory, and her 2016 performance a few days after at the MTV Video Music Awards of Make Me&hellip;, her first time returning to that particular stage since her decidedly &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; performance of &ldquo;Gimme More&rdquo; in 2007, in which she half-heartedly lip-synched, tottered around off-balance and rigid, and at one point grabbed the junk of a male dancer. (There were also pole dancers.) Spears performed her final show of the Britney: Piece of Me tour on December 31st, 2017, a performance that netted 1.172 million and was &ldquo;broadcast live with performances of Toxic and Work Bitch airing on ABC's Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve to a record audience of 25.6 million.&rdquo; Britney&rsquo;s highly personal and no doubt painful mental health journey was bore for the world to see, judge, and poke fun at. But everyone loves a comeback kid. And of course, complete transparency with the public about your private life and process of healing is the price you pay for fame and commercial success.</p>
  <p>Speaking of complete transparency with the public, January 2008 is also the month that Tom Cruise&rsquo;s legendary Scientology promotional video was leaked. I remember the Tom Cruise scientology jokes, but this was something that went right over sixth-grade, five-foot-high head. Nick Denton&rsquo;s January 15th coverage of the video on Gawker&rsquo;s site quips, &ldquo;if Tom Cruise jumping on Oprah's couch was an 8 on the scale of scary, this is a 10.&rdquo; Cruise&rsquo;s interview portion is incredibly convoluted and onomatopoeia-heavy, with a few pretty sinister cackles. The clip of the interview ends with a dramatic voice over that states &ldquo;A scientologist can be defined by a single question: would you want others to achieve the knowledge you now have? In answering that question, Tom Cruise has introduced LRH technology to over 1 billion people of earth. And that&rsquo;s only the first wave he&rsquo;s unleashed. Which is why the story of Tom Cruise, Scientologist, has only just begun.&rdquo; But the kicker here is really the heavy bass line playing in the background&mdash;superb video editing by the Sea Org there.</p>
  <p>Evidently, the 40 minute video was for a 2004 meeting of the International Association of Scientologists at which Cruise was given the &ldquo;freedom medal.&rdquo; The Church of Scientology didn&rsquo;t respond well to the reproduction of their content and claimed copyright infringement on several publications of the video, resulting in far more media attention than it likely would&rsquo;ve received otherwise.</p>
  <p>In the same month, Andrew Morton appeared on the Today Show to (somewhat defensively) discuss his forthcoming book, Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography, in which he writes of Cruise&rsquo;s relationship with the Church. When Meredith Vieira questioned Morton&rsquo;s decision to call Cruise &ldquo;compelling and dangerous,&rdquo; Morton responded, &ldquo;I think in this age of celebrity, where celebrities get a free pass to assert as opposed to argue, where they get access to presidents, prime ministers, and politicians not because of what they know but because of who they are, that &ndash; then that is &ndash; that&rsquo;s a dangerous slide into an unreflective world.&rdquo; This is a pretty fair description&ndash;the narrator of the video mentions Cruise&rsquo;s meetings with NASA as well as a Japanese Prime Minister (and calls him &ldquo;America&rsquo;s samurai&rdquo;).</p>
  <p>What better way than Morton&rsquo;s quotation to describe the last decade politically? While the 2008 campaign and election of Barack Obama were historic, of great relevance this decade later are the effects it had on the US racial climate. The country&rsquo;s first Black president led many to make the bold claim that the US had become a post-racial utopia, which the years since have proven rather unequivocally false. Clarence Page&rsquo;s 2012 &ldquo;Obama era is not a &lsquo;post-racial&rsquo; one&rdquo; in the Philadelphia Tribune confronts the facts: Gallup polls the day after Obama&rsquo;s election showed almost 70 percent of respondents felt race relations in the country were improving compared to &ldquo;33 percent in an April poll by the National Journal and the University of Phoenix.&rdquo; Most recently, Gallup&rsquo;s June 7th - July 1st 2016 results show that nationally, 5 percent of adults believed that as a result of Obama, race relations in the country had gotten a lot better, 24 percent a little better, 24 percent not changed, 23 percent gotten a little worse, and 23 percent a lot worse (with 1 percent giving no response). This is a big shift from October 2009 results, in which 41 percent of respondents felt there had been a net positive result and only 22 percent felt there was any negative. Additionally, the percentage of adults who worried a &ldquo;great deal&rdquo; or a &ldquo;fair amount&rdquo; about race relations in the US rose from 45 percent in 2008 to 62 percent in 2016. Also of contemporary importance is the birther movement that grew from the 2008 election and Trump&rsquo;s eventual involvement in it. His 2011 letter in USA Today titled &ldquo;Obama, come clean&rdquo; may have been of the same generic, jokey pabulum as Spears and Cruise at the time, but we (should, at the very least) know better now.</p>
  <p>Discussing moments like Spears&rsquo; meteoric rise and Cruise&rsquo;s cultish rants in conjunction with a presidential election and subsequent changes in perceptions of race relations may seem ham-fisted, but in the same decade Trump managed to seamlessly permeate the barrier between pap and politics. 2008 headlines with Trump&rsquo;s name covered his separation with Ivana, his buying (or not buying) Ed McMahon&rsquo;s house, and one from Fox News titled &ldquo;Pop Tarts: Donald Trump Gets Emotional Over Christina Aguilera.&rdquo; 2018 Trump headlines include &ldquo;Trump says he rejects feminism because he is 'for everyone',&rdquo; &ldquo;Trump taunts Jay-Z about black unemployment,&rdquo; (over Twitter, of course,) and &ldquo;Trump says he didn't know UK far-right group were 'horrible racists.'&rdquo; Perhaps the more we idolize celebrities, blur the lines between public, private, and political, and refuse to concern ourselves with the truth, the more the world will seem to fall apart.</p>
